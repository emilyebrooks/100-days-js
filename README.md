# Inspired by the #100DaysOfCode Challenge!

Acknowledging my desire to keep building my JavaScript skills, but also the various demands on my time, I am committing 30 minutes a day to continued JavaScript learning. Whether reading, practicing, building or experimenting, I will carve out a little time each day to better my skills and log my activity here.

## Plan:

- Plan: Practice JavaScript every day for 100 days
- Goal: 30 minutes a day
- Content: Lessons, Reviews and maybe some projects along the way
- Requirement: Log activity every day here: (log.md)
- Start: Saturday, January 22, 2022
- End: Sunday, May 1, 2022
