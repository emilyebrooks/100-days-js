### Day 10: Monday, January 31, 2022

**Today's Progress:**
Today I started a JavaScript fundamentals course on LinkedIn.

**Thoughts:**
I'm intrigued by this course already. The instructor says he will be starting the course by looking at the big picture, a complex overview of JavaScript, and then breaking it down into smaller pieces.
I appreciate this b/c I have been learning little pieces and still am unsure how they all connect together. Instructor seems excited, speaks clearly and vividly, so I believe this will be captivating.

### Day 14: Friday, February 4, 2022

**Today's Progress:**
Continued with LinkedIn JS Essentials class

**Thoughts:**
Learned how to use the GoLive feature in VSC and use the console to debug code. Instructor, Morten, explains flow of class - we will learn Objects and methods first, then learn data types and the DOM, then cover methods, functions and events at the end. He admits this is a little backwards, but I am excited to hear from a totally new perspective. Since these are all topics I have learned before, I am exciting to hear them laid out in a new way.
