### Day 10: Monday, January 31, 2022

**Today's Progress:**
Today I started a JavaScript fundamentals course on LinkedIn.

**Thoughts:**
I'm intrigued by this course already. The instructor says he will be starting the course by looking at the big picture, a complex overview of JavaScript, and then breaking it down into smaller pieces.
I appreciate this b/c I have been learning little pieces and still am unsure how they all connect together. Instructor seems excited, speaks clearly and vividly, so I believe this will be captivating.

### Day 14: Friday, February 4, 2022

**Today's Progress:**
Continued with LinkedIn JS Essentials class

**Thoughts:**
Learned how to use the GoLive feature in VSC and use the console to debug code. Instructor, Morten, explains flow of class - we will learn Objects and methods first, then learn data types and the DOM, then cover methods, functions and events at the end. He admits this is a little backwards, but I am excited to hear from a totally new perspective. Since these are all topics I have learned before, I am exciting to hear them laid out in a new way.

### Day 33: Friday, March 4, 2022

**Today's Progress:**
Watched a 1 hour JavaScript Fundamentals video from the same guy I watched yesterday

**Thoughts:**
I like watching people code. It's interesting to watch other methods or "tricks". He spoke about forms and event listeners as well as including js in the <script></script> tags inside the HTML form, so that was new to me.

**Link to work:**

### Day 34: Saturday, March 5, 2022

**Today's Progress:**
Started Color Flipper project from John Smilga. Found project on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:**
I just realized that I need to start doing actual projects. Reading and watching is fine, but it all sounds familiar at this point. I need to start doing different types of practice to bring this all to life. This color flipper concept will also translate to the VH project, where clicking will bring up a new word.

**Link to work:**

### Day 36: Tuesday, March 8, 2022

**Today's Progress:**
Finished color flip project. I also practiced this feature by adding it into the VH project.

**Thoughts:**
Super fun! And a great way to learn.

### Day 37: Wednesday, March 9, 2022

**Today's Progress:**
Started new project with John Smilga - Expandable Q&A

### Day 42: Wednesday, March 16, 2022

**Today's Progress:**
Copied over "starter files" from Brooks Psychotherapy website to serve as practice project for building out my own expand and collapse Q&A page.

**Thoughts:**
Lots to do! Reworking HTML, add JS and reformatt CSS, but I love this process! Eventually I will use this to update the clients website, too. Will be easier to read and more engaging and clean looking. Excited!

**Link to work:**
[Expandable FAQ Page Practice Project](Projects/bp-faqpage/)

### Day 43: Thursday, March 17, 2022

**Today's Progress:**
Mostly worked on setting up the FAQ page HTML and CSS files so I can apply JS to different elements.

**Thoughts:**
Didn't get to much JS today! Might have been easier to start with a blank project rather than adapting the Brooks FAQ page, but I'm making it work now. More JS to come tomorrow! And this will be great for updating the BP page when I am done.

**Link to work:**
[Expandable FAQ Page Practice Project](Projects/bp-faqpage/)

### Day 44: Friday, March 18, 2022

**Today's Progress:**
Continued formatting HTML and CSS to create the expandable Q & A's

**Thoughts:**
Love! I am enjoying working on a project where I get to do HTML, CSS and JavaScript all at the same time. Currently I am formatting the HTMl and CSS so I have the elements in place to start applying JS. I decided to clean out all of the non-relevant parts from the "starter-code" I used from the Brooks website, so it's much more focused now.

[Expandable FAQ Page Practice Project](Projects/bp-faqpage/)

### Day 45: Saturday, March 19, 2022

**Today's Progress:**
Continued formatting HTML and CSS to create the expandable Q & A's

**Thoughts:**
Pretty simple, actually. The JS is minimal. Took me more time to reformat the existing HTML and CSS from the Brooks website. I'm going to restyle this and turn it into an About Emily Q&A project for my portfolio. But then also use this to update the FAQ page on the Brooks website.

**Link to work:**
[Expandable FAQ Page Practice Project](Projects/bp-faqpage/)

### Day 46: Monday, March 21, 2022

**Today's Progress:**
Started new project - scroll page and sticky nav bar features.

**Thoughts:**
Started with just watching the video. This projects builds out more features and includes more HTML, so starting by watching and then will start coding alongside.
