### Day 9: Sunday, January 30, 2022

Today I did exercises on W3Schools. The exercises covered topics such as:
Variables, Operators, Data Types, Functions, Objects, Events, Strings, String Methods, Arrays, Array Methods, Sort, Dates, Math and Comparisons

**Thoughts:**
It was fun and good practice to move through various topics and have to use recall to solve the problems.
Overall this was easy, but I like that kind of refresher from time to time.

### Day 10: Monday, January 31, 2022

**Today's Progress:**
Today I started a JavaScript fundamentals course on LinkedIn.

**Thoughts:**
I'm intrigued by this course already. The instructor says he will be starting the course by looking at the big picture, a complex overview of JavaScript, and then breaking it down into smaller pieces.
I appreciate this b/c I have been learning little pieces and still am unsure how they all connect together. Instructor seems excited, speaks clearly and vividly, so I believe this will be captivating.

### Day 13: Thursday, February 3, 2022

**Today's Progress:**
Continued with LinkedIn JS Essentials class

**Thoughts:**
Mostly just setting up my workspace with the course files and suggested best extensions for VSC. I am excited to being exposed to a totally new instructor and course style. I always learn something new when watching or learning from new people.

### Day 14: Friday, February 4, 2022

**Today's Progress:**
Continued with LinkedIn JS Essentials class

**Thoughts:**
Learned how to use the GoLive feature in VSC and use the console to debug code. Instructor, Morten, explains flow of class - we will learn Objects and methods first, then learn data types and the DOM, then cover methods, functions and events at the end. He admits this is a little backwards, but I am excited to hear from a totally new perspective. Since these are all topics I have learned before, I am exciting to hear them laid out in a new way.
